    <p>
      Well I was going to buy you a month or so supply of Friday morning/day
      time exercise classes. Like jazzercise or Zumba or something. However, I
      wen to buy that yesterday, and we couldnâ€™t afford it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found a few good offers from jazzercise, and orange theory, and a couple
      others. But really they were all pretty temporary options.
    </p>
    <p>
      But last night, I saw 24 hour has a year membership for $240! They offer
      weekly friday Zumba classes that you could almost always go to, and be
      able to work out/go to other classes when you can.
    </p>
    <p>
      So this is is an IOU. When my invoice comes in we will get you a 24 hour
      membership UNLESS you want to try a different place out.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know you've been wanting to work out more, and I know you like classes.
      Let's make it happ'n cap'n!
